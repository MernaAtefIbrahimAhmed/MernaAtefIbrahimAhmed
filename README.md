- Linux systems & Bash scripting

🛠 Languages & Tools I work with:
- *Programming Languages:* C, C++, Python, Java, JavaFX
- *Web Technologies:* HTML, CSS
- *Hardware:* Arduino, Microcontrollers, Logic Gates, Sensors
- *EDA Tools:* PCB Design (e.g., EasyEDA, KiCAD)
- *Platforms:* Linux, Git & GitHub, ROS
- *Hardware Description Languages:* VHDL

🌱 Currently developing:
- A 32-bit MIPS Processor using VHDL
- A gesture-to-speech system for mute individuals using ATmega32
- Robotic systems for competitions (e.g., firefighting robot, Micromouse)
